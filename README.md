# grafana-git-sync-demo

Hey there! This is a fun demo showing how to use [Grafana Git Sync](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/provision-resources/git-sync-setup/) and [grafanactl](https://github.com/grafana/grafanactl).

## Target Audience

This demo is designed for:
- **DevOps Engineers** looking to implement Observability as Code practices.
- **SREs** wanting to version control their monitoring dashboards.
- **Grafana Users** interested in automating dashboard management.
- **Teams** seeking to improve collaboration on dashboard development.
- **Anyone** curious about Grafana's Git Sync feature and its capabilities.

## Requirements

- A terminal (you've got this!).
- Image rendering up and running. Check out the [Image Rendering documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/image-rendering/).
- Grafana nightly build with Git Sync enabled. Follow the [Git Sync documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/provision-resources/git-sync-setup/) and make sure webhooks and image rendering are set up so pull request comments and instant sync work smoothly.
- An empty repository to push and pull changes.
- A PAT (Personal Access Token) with the right permissions for your repository, including webhook events and pull requests. See [Create a Github Access Token](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/provision-resources/git-sync-setup/#create-a-github-access-token).
- Some dashboards and folders already created in your Grafana instance.
- [grafanactl](https://grafana.github.io/grafanactl/installation/) installed.

## Intro

> [!WARNING]
> Git Sync is currently in an experimental phase and may have limitations or breaking changes. While it represents Grafana's first step toward comprehensive Observability as Code, we don't recommend using it in production or critical environments.

[Git Sync](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/provision-resources/) is Grafana's solution for implementing [Observability as Code (OaC)](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/). It enables bi-directional synchronization between your Grafana dashboards and a Git repository, allowing you to:

- Version control your dashboards and other Grafana resources
- Review changes through pull requests with visual previews
- Automate dashboard deployments
- Collaborate with team members using familiar Git workflows
- Maintain a single source of truth for your observability stack

This demo will walk you through setting up Git Sync and using it to manage your Grafana dashboards effectively.

## Step 1: Migrate Dashboards to GitHub

Here's how to migrate your existing dashboards to GitHub and enable bi-directional sync between Grafana and GitHub:

1. In Grafana:
    1. Go to `Dashboards` and check out your existing dashboards and folders.
1. In GitHub:
    1. Open your repository on `github.com` to see what's inside.
1. In Grafana, go to `TODO/provisioning` to set up your first repository:
    1. Paste your PAT token and enter your repository details. Click "Next."
    1. Grafana will show you how many dashboards are in your instance and ask if you want to migrate them to GitHub.
    1. Select the migration option and start the process.
    1. Wait for the migration to complete. Grafana will tell you how many dashboards were migrated.
    1. Enable the `TODO` option to allow dashboard preview screenshots on pull requests.
    1. Click "Finish."
1. In GitHub:
    1. Refresh your repository to see a new `/grafana` folder with your dashboards.
    1. Open a dashboard file to quickly review its contents.
1. In Grafana:
    1. Open the GitHub connection by clicking `TODO`.
    1. Check out the repository status page (e.g., dashboard count, recent jobs, resources tab, and files tab).

That's it! Your Grafana instance is now connected to GitHub with Git Sync, keeping everything in sync.

## Step 2: Use Pull Requests for Your Dashboards

You can edit dashboards in Grafana and submit changes as pull requests in GitHub before they go live:

1. In Grafana:
    1. Go to `Dashboards` and open a dashboard. Provisioned dashboards will have a purple `<->` badge.
    1. Open a dashboard.
    1. Make and save your changes. A new drawer will pop up for provisioned dashboards.
    1. Write a commit message.
    1. Click "TODO" to create a branch for your changes.
    1. The UI will redirect you to the dashboards page and show a banner indicating this is a preview and not yet live in Grafana. The banner will offer an `Open Pull Request` button.
    1. Click `Open Pull Request`.
    1. You'll be redirected to your repository on `github.com` to open the pull request.
1. In GitHub:
    1. Open the pull request.
    1. Wait a few seconds for the Grafana integration to comment on the pull request with before-and-after previews of your dashboard changes.
    1. Merge the pull request.
1. In Grafana:
    1. Go to your dashboard (or refresh) to see the changes applied automatically.

## Step 3: Edit a Dashboard from Github

1. In Github, 
    1. Go to the dashboard you previously modified (or another one). 
    1. Edit the title of a panel (e.g. "Modified From Github"). 
    1. Save and push to the branch. 
1. In Grafana, 
    1. Go to that dashboard (or refresh).
    1. See that changes are now reflected.

## Step 4: Edit a Dashboard Using `grafanactl`

> `grafanactl` is a command-line tool that helps you manage Grafana resources like dashboards, folders, and datasources. The tool integrates with Git Sync, allowing you to manage your dashboards through both the Grafana UI and command line, giving you flexibility in how you work with your dashboards.

Here is how you can edit dashboards using `grafanactl` and see the changes reflected in both GitHub and Grafana:

In your terminal:  
TODO
```bash

grafanactl -h
grafanactl resources pull
grafanactl resources get dashboards
grafanactl resource edit dashboard <ID>
grafanactl resources push
```

ðŸŽ‰ Excellent work! You've now mastered Git Sync for Grafana dashboards and can confidently manage your dashboards through multiple interfaces - the Grafana UI, GitHub, and the command line. This setup enables collaborative dashboard development with proper version control and review processes. ðŸŽ‰

Thank you for following along with this guide. You're now part of an elite group who keep their dashboards version-controlled and collaborative. Happy dashboarding! ðŸš€
